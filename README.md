### **Project Overview**
---
The goal of this project is to analyze the customer data  for a subscription services  to identify segments and sales trends.

### **Tools Used**
---
- Microsoft Excel  [Download](https://www.microsoft.com)
1.  For Data Cleaning
2.  For Analysis
3.  For Visualization

* SQL: Structured Query Language for querying data

* GitHub: Portfolio building

* Power BI: Visualization

 ### **Data Cleaning and Preparation**
In the initial phase of data cleaning and preparation, we perform the following actions:
* Data loading and inspection
* Handling missing variables
* Data cleaning and formatting

### **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
 ---
EDA involved examining the data to answer various questions such as:
* What is the overall monthly subscription trend?
* Which customer are the top subscriber?
* Which subscription plan was canceled?

Here are the steps taken to complete this project:

1. **Cleaning of the Sales Data:**

* Open the Excel Worksheet.

* Highlight the data.

* Click on the Data Tab.

* Select "Remove Duplicates" to eliminate any duplicate entries.

2.Calculate Total Duration and Average Duration:

* Formula for Total Duration: =(SubscriptionEnd - SubscriptionStart)

* Formula for Average Duration: =AVERAGE(I2:I33788)

# Data Analysis
---
Here, we include basic lines of code, queries, and some of the DAX expressions used during the analysis.

```SQL
[UploadCREATE DATABASE Customer_DB

SELECT * FROM [dbo].[Customer Data]

--------TOTAL NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS FROM EACH REGION-------
SELECT Region, COUNT(CustomerID) AS total_customers
FROM [Customer Data]
GROUP BY Region;

--------MOST POPULAR SUBSCRIPTION TYPE BY THE NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS-------
SELECT SubscriptionType , COUNT(CustomerID) AS customer_count
FROM [Customer Data]
GROUP BY SubscriptionType
ORDER BY customer_count DESC

--------CUSTOMERS WHO CANCELED THEIR SUBSCRIPTION WITHIN 6 MONTHS-------
SELECT CustomerID
FROM [Customer Data]
WHERE DATEDIFF(month, SubscriptionStart, Canceled) <= 6;

---------AVERAGE SUBSCRIPTION DURATION FOR ALL CUSTOMERS-------
SELECT AVG(DATEDIFF (DAY,SubscriptionStart,SubscriptionEnd)) AS AVG_SUBSCRIPTION_DURATION
FROM [Customer Data]
WHERE DATEDIFF(MONTH, SubscriptionStart,SubscriptionEnd)
>12;

---------CUSTOMERS WITH SUBSCRIPTIONS LONGER THAN 12 MONTHS-------
SELECT AVG(DATEDIFF (DAY,SubscriptionStart,SubscriptionEnd)) AS AVG_SUBSCRIPTION_DURATION
FROM [Customer Data]

---------TOTAL REVENUE BY SUBSCRIPTION TYPE-------
SELECT SubscriptionType, SUM(Revenue) AS Total_Revenue
FROM [Customer Data]
GROUP BY SubscriptionType;

---------TOP 3 REGIONS BY SUBSCRIPTION CANCELLATIONS---------
SELECT TOP 3 Region, COUNT(*) AS SUBSCRIPTIONEND_COUNT
FROM [Customer Data]
WHERE SubscriptionEnd IS NULL
GROUP BY Region
ORDER BY SUBSCRIPTIONEND_COUNT DESC;


---------TOP 3 REGIONS BY SUBSCRIPTION CANCELLATIONS-------
SELECT Region, COUNT(CustomerID) AS cancellations
FROM [Customer Data]
WHERE Canceled IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY Region
ORDER BY cancellations DESC

---------TOTAL NUMBER OF ACTIVE AND CANCELED SUBSCRIPTIONS -------
SELECT 
    COUNT(CASE WHEN canceled IS NULL THEN 1 END) AS active_subscriptions,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN canceled IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) AS canceled_subscriptions
FROM [Customer Data]ing SQLQuery3.sqlâ€¦]()

Total Sales = SUM('Sales'[SalesAmount])
